# EVERLEGENDS — Premium Website Rebuild

## Brand Identity (Preserved)
- **EVERLEGENDS** wordmark — exact lettering retained
- **"E" emblem** — unchanged
- **Brand gradient** (teal → blue → violet) — used sparingly as accent highlights only
- Logo proportions and colors untouched

---

## Design System

### Color Palette
- **Base**: Near-black charcoal (`#0A0A0B`) as dominant background
- **Surface**: Slightly lighter dark (`#111113`) for subtle section differentiation
- **Text**: Pure white for headlines, `#A0A0A8` muted gray for body
- **Accent**: Brand gradient (teal → blue → violet) used only for CTA buttons, thin rules, and select typographic highlights
- **No** large gradient washes or colorful section backgrounds

### Typography
- **Headlines**: Uppercase geometric sans-serif (e.g., Inter or similar), tight letter-spacing (-0.02em to -0.04em), bold/black weight, large scale
- **Body**: Same family, light weight (300-400), generous line-height (1.6-1.7)
- **Strong typographic hierarchy**: Hero text ~80-96px, section titles ~40-48px, body ~16-18px

### Spacing
- Generous vertical padding between sections (120-160px)
- Content max-width constrained (~1200px) with ample horizontal margins
- 30-40% more whitespace than typical layouts

### Motion
- Subtle fade-in-up on scroll (elements appear with gentle upward drift)
- Slight text reveal animations (staggered by line)
- No aggressive, bouncy, or rapid animations
- Navigation background transitions smoothly from transparent to solid on scroll

## Page Structure (Single-Page Scroll Narrative)

### Navigation
- Minimal transparent top bar over hero
- EVERLEGENDS wordmark on left, 2-3 text links + CTA button on right
- Transitions to solid dark background on scroll
- Clean, no oversized dropdowns

### Section 1 — Hero (Full Viewport)
- Full-screen dark muted looping background video (atmospheric, cinematic — 3-5 second loop)
- Large bold uppercase headline: **"WHERE MERIT IS THE ONLY CURRENCY"** (or similar declarative statement)
- One short sub-line beneath
- Single gradient-accented CTA button: **"Enter the Arena"**
- EVERLEGENDS wordmark subtly visible
- No clutter — just statement, sub-line, and button

### Section 2 — Philosophy
- Large centered statement in bold uppercase (e.g., **"TALENT SHOULD BE REWARDED. PERIOD."**)
- 2-3 lines of minimal supporting text in muted gray beneath
- Massive whitespace above and below
- No images, no icons — pure typographic impact

### Section 3 — How It Works
- Section title: **"THE SYSTEM"**
- Three steps displayed horizontally with clean vertical dividing lines:
  - **COMPETE** — Enter real athletic challenges
  - **PROVE** — Your performance is verified and ranked
  - **RISE** — Earn rewards based on merit alone
- Minimal iconography or purely typographic emphasis
- Clean, grid-aligned layout

### Section 4 — Rewards / System
- Presented as a **technical specification sheet** aesthetic
- Clean grid with label-value pairs (like a product spec table)
- Information about the rewards system, rankings, verification
- Thin gradient accent lines as dividers
- No colorful cards or blocks — monochrome with subtle gradient highlights

### Section 5 — Download App
- Strong final CTA section
- Bold headline: **"READY TO COMPETE?"**
- App store badges (Google Play, Apple — when available)
- Controlled gradient accent on the CTA button only
- Clean, dark background — no gradient background overload
- Minimal footer beneath with copyright, social links, and legal links

## Key Design Decisions
- **No card-heavy layouts** — content floats cleanly on the dark background
- **No decorative borders, shadows, or containers** — structure comes from spacing and alignment
- **Grid-strict alignment** throughout all sections
- **Video hero** uses a placeholder dark atmospheric video (can be swapped later with branded footage)
- **Responsive**: Sections stack vertically on mobile with maintained spacing proportions
- **Overall tone**: Confident, engineered, cinematic — a serious global platform, not a startup landing page
